# 👋 Hi, I'm Alejandra Guerra

💻 **Software Engineer | Tech Lead | Frontend Specialist**  
I design and build scalable web applications, lead engineering teams, and explore modern approaches to solve complex problems.  
With strong experience in **frontend (React, Svelte, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind)** and solid foundations in **backend and devops (Node.js, C#, PostgreSQL, Nginx, Docker, microservices)**, I thrive at the intersection of usability, performance, and system design.

## 🚀 About Me

- 🌐 **Professional Experience**:  
  Currently working at **Servicio de Administración Tributaria (SAT, Mexico)** where I’ve led **20+ microservices projects** in legal and administrative domains (expedientes jurídicos, notificaciones, responsivas de aplicativos, evaluaciones de confiabilidad).  
  I direct **25+ engineers across 4+ development cells**, managing processes, architecture decisions, and large-scale deployments.

- 🧭 **Technical Leadership**:  
  Conducted **40+ interviews** for frontend/tech-lead roles, guiding teams through clean architecture, design patterns, and performance optimization.  

- 🎓 **Academic Involvement**:  
  Active in **competitive programming** since my university days at **UNAM (FES Acatlán)**, regional ICPC contestant, and still collaborating with **GUAPA programming group**.  
  Recently finished a **Diplomado en Tecnologías de la Información y Comunicaciones (2024–2025)**.  

- 🛠️ **Personal Projects**:  
  - Building a **competitive programming judge platform** (similar to LeetCode/Codeforces) for my university community, with features like scoreboard freeze, practice vs contest modes, and PostgreSQL schema designed for extensibility.  
  - Constantly exploring **algorithms, data structures, and system design** — I create content (flashcards, Anki decks, UML diagrams) for students and engineers.
